In addition, it was necessary to correct the different levels of education and change the values to lower case, categorize the popurpose column into several main purpose that contain all the types of purpose mentioned, and overcome the problem of repeatative rows.\n",

In this project, one criterion is examined each time, which affects the client's ability to repay a loan on time. Among the relationships examined were the relationship between the level of income and the ability to repay on time, people with or without children, marital status and the purpose of taking the loan.\n",

However, at the same time, when the customer comes to the bank to receive a loan, it is necessary to weigh all the data in order to determine the situation of each customer individually."
